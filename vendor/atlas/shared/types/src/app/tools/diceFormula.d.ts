/**
 * Parses and rolls dice formulas such as `2d6+3`, `d20+2d6` or `2d6-1d4`.
 * Every term carries its own sign, so the `+2` of `+2d6` is a dice count and
 * never a modifier, and subtracted dice subtract.
 *
 * A dice term may explode (`diceExplosion.ts`): by its own notation, written
 * as Obsidian's Dice Roller writes it since statblocks use that (`2d6!` once,
 * `2d6!3` up to three times, `2d6!i` again and again; `!!` reads the same), or
 * by the collection's rule.
